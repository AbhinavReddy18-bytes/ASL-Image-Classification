## About The Project
The project focuses on classifying American Sign Language (ASL) characters using neural networks (CNN) and some complex preprocessing of the large input file. The goal is to identify and analyze hand symbols that represent different ASL signs. The model uses a 4-layer CNN to process and classify ASL signed images. After training the model with data, the trained model data will be saved in the other HDF5 file and testing data evaluates this HDF5 file and gives the output and predictions.
<br />

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images representing various ASL signs named "data_train.npy"(This dataset contains 8443 samples of data.)and "labels_train.npy"(This dataset consists of the lables provided in a certain manner). Each image is labeled with the corresponding ASL sign it represents. These datsets are of large files so can't upload in the github repository. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the CNN model effectively. 
<br />

## Results
The model achieved a promising accuracy rate, indicating its capability to correctly classify ASL signs. Detailed performance metrics can be found in the testing results section of this repository.
